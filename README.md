# MyOwnAutoShop - OOP_Project
This is a repository for the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) project developed by Cristina Ciotlaus.

The project consists of a Java program that implements various OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. 
The program simulates a car dealership where different types of cars are sold, such as Sedans and Fords.

The code is organized into separate classes for each car type and a main class that initializes the car instances and calculates their sale prices.
